# Bayesian Blocks Algorithm
Final Project for the **Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis** course, Physics of Data degree at University of Padua.

## Assignment:
**Bayesian Blocks**: a dynamic algorithm for histogram representation.

It is a non-parametric representation of data derived with a bayesian statistical procedure. It has been
invented by D. Scargle [^1][^3] and applied in the context of astronomical time series analysis. A similar
technique available on the market is the kernel density estimation (KDE). As described in [^2], it allows
to discover local struture in background data, exploiting the full information brought by the data.
The main idea is based on segmentation of the data interval into variable-sized blocks, each containing
consecutive data satisfying some well defined criteria.

Write an algorithm and then test its performances with different sets of data. </br>
Try to think other possible application of the method.
