Final Project for the "Advanced Statistics for Physics Analysis" course, Physics of Data degree at University of Padua.

## Assignment:
Bayesian Blocks: a dynamic algorithm for histogram representation
It is a non-parametric representation of data derived with a bayesian statistical procedure. It has been
invented by D. Scargle and applied in the context of astronomical time series analysis. A similar
technique available on the market is the kernel density estimation (KDE). As described in [2], it allows
to discover local struture in background data, exploiting the full information brought by the data.
The main idea is based on segmentation of the data interval into variable-sized blocks, each containing
consecutive data satisfying some well dened criteria.
Write an alorithm and then test its performances with different sets of data.
Try to think other possible application of the method.
